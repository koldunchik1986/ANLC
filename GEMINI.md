## Project Overview

This project, ANLC, appears to be a hybrid application consisting of a C# Windows Forms client (`ABClient`) and an Android application. The primary focus seems to be the `ABClient`, which acts as a custom client for a web-based game.

**Core Components:**

*   **`ABClient` (C# Windows Forms):** This is a rich client application that appears to wrap a web-based game. It provides a custom user interface, automation tools, and other features not available in the standard web version of the game. It includes a local proxy to intercept and modify game traffic, and uses a `WebBrowser` control to display the game's interface, augmented with custom JavaScript files.
*   **Android App:** An Android application is included in the `app` directory. Its purpose is not immediately clear from the file structure, but it may be a companion app or a mobile version of the client.
*   **JavaScript:** A collection of JavaScript files are used to interact with and enhance the game's web interface within the C# client.

**Technologies:**

*   **C#:** .NET Framework 2.0, Windows Forms
*   **Android:** Gradle, Kotlin
*   **JavaScript:** Used for web-based game interaction.

## Building and Running

### ABClient (C# Application)

To build and run the `ABClient` application, you will need Visual Studio or the .NET Framework SDK.

1.  **Open the solution:** Open the `ABClient10.sln` file in Visual Studio.
2.  **Build the project:** Build the solution (usually with `Ctrl+Shift+B` or by selecting "Build Solution" from the "Build" menu).
3.  **Run the application:** The output executable will be in the `abclient/bin/Debug/` or `abclient/bin/Release/` directory.

Alternatively, you can use `msbuild` from the command line:

```shell
msbuild ABClient10.sln
```

### Android App

To build and run the Android application, you will need Android Studio or the Android SDK and Gradle.

1.  **Open the project:** Open the `ANLC` project in Android Studio.
2.  **Build the project:** Build the project using the "Build" menu.
3.  **Run the application:** Run the application on an emulator or a physical device.

Alternatively, you can use Gradle from the command line:

```shell
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Development Conventions

*   **C#:** The C# code appears to follow standard .NET conventions. The presence of a `Settings.StyleCop` file suggests that StyleCop is used for code style enforcement.
*   **Project Structure:** The project is organized into several folders, each with a specific purpose (e.g., `ABForms` for forms, `ABProxy` for the local proxy, `MyProfile` for user profiles).
*   **JavaScript:** The JavaScript files are likely used to interact with the DOM of the game's web pages.
